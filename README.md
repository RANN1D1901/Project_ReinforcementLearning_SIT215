# Project_ReinforcementLearning_SIT215
Working of The code: In first section of the code, the environment is intialised and then the q table of relevant size is generated and intialised and hyperparameters necesaary are declared, within the loop the q table is updated following bellman equation and the is repeated for the number of episodes stated. This is how the agent learns using the algorithm stated, at last the environment is render at each step to see the progress of the agent.
In the end various graphs are plotted to observe performance of the algorithm being used.
This is a repository as part of the submission of SIT 215 project, this includes the implementation of three different environments in OPEN AI gym library which includes:
1) Taxi Environment
2) Cart Pole Environment
3) Mountain Environment
